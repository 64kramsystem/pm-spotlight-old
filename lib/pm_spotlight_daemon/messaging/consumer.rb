    # A trivial serializer, used for de/serializing the messages containing the find results.

    # It requires the messages not to contain null bytes (`\x00`), since they're used as message
    # terminator; this is acceptable since filenames don't contain it (it's illegal).

    #
    # 1. if multiple messages are received, it releases only the last one;
    # 2. it buffers the incoming messages; if only part is received, it waits for the remainder
    #    before releasing it.
