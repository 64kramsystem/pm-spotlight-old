    # Searches files like GNU `find`, around 3 times as slow (for my average use case), but without
    # the need to use subshells.
    #
    # Using pure Ruby is actually a requirement for being able to terminate the search on demand,
    # as it's not always possible to terminate and clean forked processes.
    #
    # The code has been profiled and optimized. For performance reasons, it is limited in its
    # functionality.
